Messi's dribbling skills and ability to create chances for his teammates are unmatched. He has consistently been the top scorer in La Liga and has broken multiple records in the process. Messi's loyalty to Barcelona also speaks to his character as a player, as he has stayed with the club for his entire career, unlike Ronaldo who has moved around multiple times.

He has also won multiple Champions League titles with different teams, which is a testament to his ability to perform at the highest level.

Messi has an incredible ability to control the ball and create opportunities for his teammates, making him a true team player. He also has an incredible scoring record, having scored over 700 goals in his career, many of which were scored in important matches. While Ronaldo has won the Ballon d'Or in different leagues, Messi has consistently performed at a high level in the same league, which shows his consistency and dedication to his team.
